# Hangman - Game

## Game rules
The goal is to guess the hidden word, with each of its letters represented by horizontal dashes.
If the guessed letter is present in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s) (including multiple times if it occurs more than once).
Otherwise, the vertical dashes representing the remaining attempts will decrease by one. When all vertical dashes disappear after 6 incorrect guesses, the game is over â€” the player is 'hanged'.

## What features does the game offer?
- **Two-player mode**: One player chooses a word, and the second player tries to guess it;
- **Solo mode**: The game selects a random word from a .txt file, and the player tries to guess it;
- **Round history**: All game rounds are saved in a .txt file, which can be read later.
